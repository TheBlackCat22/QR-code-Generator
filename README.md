# QR-code-Generator
This Program uses the google drive api to automate uploading images to a certain folder in my google drive, it then creates a qr-code for the sharing url of that image.

This code is going to be used as a lisence plate generator for every cycle on my college campus so that the owner of each cycle is always known.
On scanning the qr-code on any cycle, we will be able to view the image of the id-card of its owner.
